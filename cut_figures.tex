\caption{\label{fig:res-flux-FHR}Relative flux enhancements of $E$ (left column), $L_z$ (middle) and $Q$ (right) for resonance ratios corresponding to the 1:3, 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4 resonances. We show results as computed here with a solid red line, and results from Flanagan, Hughes and Ruangeri (FHR14)~\cite{Flanagan2012a} with a dashed blue line. Each row has a different eccentricity and inclination corresponding to tables I--IV in FHR14. All systems have $a_\ast=0.9$.}

The plus-polarisation of the GW at the start and end of the evolution is shown in the top row of \figref{good-waveform}.

Plotting the plus-polarised GWs at the start and end of the evolution, as before, demonstrates this dephasing, as shown in \figref{dephased-waveform}.

The full and adiabatic models are both shown; there is a significant dephasing between them by the end of the evolution.}
