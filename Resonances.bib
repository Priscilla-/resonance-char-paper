	abstract = {One of the main channels of interactions in galactic nuclei between stars and the central massive black hole ({MBH}) is the gradual inspiral of compact remnants into the {MBH} due to the emission of gravitational radiation. This process is known as an ‘extreme mass ratio inspiral’ ({EMRI}). Previous works about the estimation of how many events space observatories such as {LISA} will be able to observe during its operational time differ in orders of magnitude, due to the complexity of the problem. Nevertheless, a common result to all investigations is that the possibility that a compact object merges with the {MBH} after only one intense burst of gravitational waves is much more likely than a slow adiabatic inspiral, an {EMRI}. The latter is referred to as a ‘plunge’ because the compact object dives into the {MBH}, crosses the horizon and is lost as a probe of strong gravity for evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ({eLISA}). The event rates for plunges are orders of magnitude larger than slow inspirals. On the other hand, nature {MBH}'s are most likely Kerr and the magnitude of the spin has been sized up to be high. We calculate the number of periapsis passages that a compact object set on to an extremely radial orbit goes through before being actually swallowed by the Kerr {MBH} and we then translate it into an event rate for a {LISA}-like observatory, such as the proposed European Space Agency mission {eLISA}/New Gravitational wave Observatory. We prove that a ‘plunging’ compact object is conceptually indistinguishable from an adiabatic, slow inspiral; plunges spend on average up to hundred of thousands of cycles in the bandwidth of the detector for a 2 yr mission. This has an important impact on the event rate, enhancing in some cases significantly, depending on the spin of the {MBH} and the inclination. If the orbit of the {EMRI} is prograde, the effective size of the {MBH} becomes smaller for larger spin, whilst if retrograde, it becomes bigger. However, this situation is not symmetric, resulting in an effective enhancement of the rates. The effect of vectorial resonant relaxation on the sense of the orbit does not affect the enhancement. Moreover, it has been recently proved that the production of low-eccentricity {EMRIs} is severely blocked by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which orbital angular momentum change takes place. This is the result of relativistic precession on to the stellar potential torques and hence affects {EMRIs} originating via resonant relaxation at distances of about ∼10−2 pc from the {MBH}. Since high-eccentricity {EMRIs} are a result of two-body relaxation, they are not affected by this phenomenon. Therefore, we predict that {eLISA} {EMRI} event rates will be dominated by high-eccentricity binaries, as we present here.},

	abstract = {Captures of stellar-mass compact objects ({COs}) by massive (∼106M⊙) black holes ({MBHs}) are potentially an important source for {LISA}, the proposed space-based gravitational-wave ({GW}) detector. The orbits of the inspiraling {COs} are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up until the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion precession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The amplitudes of the strongest {GW} signals are expected to be roughly an order of magnitude smaller than {LISA}’s instrumental noise, but in principle (i.e., with sufficient computing power) the {GW} signals can be disentangled from the noise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in hand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before {LISA} launches. Here we introduce a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) capture waveforms, given in (nearly) analytic form, for use in advancing {LISA} studies until more accurate versions are available. Our model waveforms include most of the key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of capture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the {MBH}’s spin). Here we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative contributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total signal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which {LISA} will be able to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured waveform. For a typical source (a 10M⊙ {CO} captured by a 106M⊙ {MBH} at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30), we find that {LISA} can determine the {MBH} and {CO} masses to within a fractional error of ∼10-4, measure S/M2 (where S and M are the {MBH}’s mass and spin) to within ∼10-4, and determine the location to the source on the sky to within ∼10-3 stradians.},

We use analytical and Monte Carlo methods to analyze the interplay between {GW} dissipation and scattering in the presence of a mass sink during the transition from the initial scattering-dominated phase to the final dissipation-dominated phase of the inspiral. Our main results are as follows. (1) Stars typically enter the {GW}-emitting phase with high eccentricities. (2) The {GW} event rate per galaxy is a few × 10-9 yr-1 for typical central stellar cusps, almost independently of the relaxation time or the {MBH} mass.

	abstract = {Inspiral signals from binary black holes, in particular those with masses in the range may last for only a few cycles within a detector's most sensitive frequency band. The spectrum of a square-windowed time-domain signal could contain unwanted power that can cause problems in gravitational wave data analysis, particularly when the waveforms are of short duration. There may be leakage of power into frequency bins where no such power is expected, causing an excess of false alarms. We present a method of tapering the time-domain waveforms that significantly reduces unwanted leakage of power, leading to a spectrum that agrees very well with that of a long duration signal. Our tapered window also decreases the false alarms caused by instrumental and environmental transients that are picked up by templates with spurious signal power. The suppression of background is an important goal in noise-dominated searches and can lead to an improvement in the detection efficiency of the search algorithms.},

The calculations apply for arbitrary eccentricity of the relative orbit, but assume orbital velocities are small. The total rate, angular distribution, and polarization of the radiated energy are discussed.},
